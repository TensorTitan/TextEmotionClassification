Introduction
This project uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to classify emotions based on user reviews. The model is trained on Spotify reviews and achieves 90% accuracy.
Key highlights include:

Text preprocessing (tokenization, stop-word removal, and word vectorization).
Emotion detection by analyzing review sentiments.
Features
Emotion classification from textual reviews.
Preprocessing steps include:
Stop-word removal.
Filtering non-emotion-representative words.
Tokenization with CountVectorizer.
Achieves high classification accuracy.
Technologies Used
Language: Python
Libraries:
Scikit-learn (for CountVectorizer and preprocessing)
Keras/TensorFlow (for ANN implementation)
NumPy, Pandas (for data manipulation)
Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualizations, if applicable)
Model Pipeline
Data Preprocessing:

Reviews were tokenized using CountVectorizer.
Stop words and words unrelated to emotions were removed.
Feature Extraction:

Word tokenization was performed using CountVectorizer.
Model:

Artificial Neural Network (ANN) architecture.
Optimized for high accuracy on classification.
Training and Validation:

Model trained on Spotify reviews dataset.
Achieved 90% accuracy on the test set.
Dataset
The dataset consisted of user reviews from Spotify. Text data was cleaned and labeled to reflect various emotional states.
